### Project 1: SQL
##### Investigate a Relational Database

### Description:

Use SQL to explore a database related to movie rentals.  Write SQL code to run SQL queries and answer interesting questions about the database.  Run SQL queries and build visualizations to showcase the output.
For the presentation component, I created four slides. Each slide:

- Having a question of interest.
- Having a supporting SQL query needed to answer the question.
- Having a supporting visualization created using the final data of your SQL query that answers your question of interest.
- Having a small summary of the visualisation in each slide.
