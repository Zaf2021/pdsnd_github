Project BikeShare
You provided me with a feedback that the code was not working properly in regards if the user inputed the answer
in a combination of Lower & Caps case.

I had the code checked by a mentor - Ron , through the help function

https://knowledge.udacity.com/questions/670929

The mentor suggested to re-submit confirming the code is good.
